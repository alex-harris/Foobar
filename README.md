# Google Foobar Challenge

I recently got a funky pop up while doing some reading about Python and it turns out I had been invited to the Google Foobar challenge. After some quick searching I discovered it was a series of programming problems that Google uses for their ðŸ¤«*seeecret*ðŸ¤« hiring process. Although I'm not a programmer, I have been learning Python so I thought I'd give it a shot.

## I want to play
Once you accept, you are taken to a Linux-y shell within Chrome where you can use a couple of commands to change directories and view/edit files. The solutions can be written in either Java or Python. We start off as a lowly Minion :

Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

## Level 1

Prompt: [Braille Translation](Questions/1_Braille_Translation.md)

As you'll see in the prompt, Google gives you two test cases that should pass, but there are also **hidden** test cases that need to pass when you run your program. This became more of an issue for me in Level 3.

The first problem was not so bad, I found a translation chart on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_ASCII) to help. The idea here is to map the characters in your string to the corresponding Braille, then use a for loop to build the translated string from scratch.

Solution: [braille.py](Code/braille.py)

## Level 2

Prompt: [Elevator Maintenance](Questions/2.1_Elevator_Maintenance.md)

Level 2 had two problems, both seemingly straightforward but with some key components that needed to be implemented into the solutions. Also, make sure to read every detail in the prompts, so you don't spend half an hour questioning your logic when all you had to do was convert your output from integer to string.
